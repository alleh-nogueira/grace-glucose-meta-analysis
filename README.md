# Added Value of Admission Blood Glucose on the GRACE Risk Score: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

We provide the R code used in our systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the incremental value of blood glucose on top of the [GRACE score](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17032691/) for prognostic risk prediction in patients with acute coronary syndrome.
